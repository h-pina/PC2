# About

This repository was created as a way to archive my resolutions of the problems and exercises of the discipline of Computer Programming 2. However, if you think something can be added or improved on the solutions, feel free to make a PR!

I've never coded in Java before and I'm an overall begginer programmer, so some of the code might have a bad structure and/or be inefficient. But I'll try to improve it in the best way possible!

# Some notes

I used the [Apache NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/) to write all the code in this repository, but since I didn't knew how it worked at first, I created the projects using the default configurations, so some of the folder structures might contain names like
*com/mycompany* . I'll fix it later to more readable and intuitive names!
